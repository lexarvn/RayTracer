RayTracer
=========

Ray Tracing program for realistic renderings.

Supported effects: caustics, reflections, color bleed, shadows, indirect lighting, depth of field, anti-aliasing, specular jitter, and motion blur. 

Supported objects: triangles, spheres, and meshes defined by plain text ply files.

Supported materials: diffuse, specular, dielectric, emmissive, and compound marterials defined as ratios of other materials. 


Textures can be defined as bitmaps, colors, and soild noise.

Timelines can be defined for animation.


All programming done in c++11.

Scenes are defined in c++. Examples can be found in Main.cpp

Depends on optional from boost library.


Note: Bitmaps and ply files must be in the same working directory as the compiled program.
